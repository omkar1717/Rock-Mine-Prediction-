Sonar data in a csv file is taken for training and testing purpose. Data preprocessing is done on the available sonar data which is suitable for training the model. After Data preprocessing, a Logistic regression model is built. The dataset is split into testing and training sets. The training data is used to train the model then the new data/ testing data is given to the trained logistic regression model for prediction.
